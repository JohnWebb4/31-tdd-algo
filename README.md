# Test-Driven Development Algo
This is a TDD algorithm training repository created by the31 using jest.

## Getting Started
You must install jest to run the tests.

This will tell you the version of jest installed.
```
jest --version
```

Install jest
```
npm install -g jest jest-cli
```

## How this thing works
cd into the root directory.
For example, if you want to run the test on fizzbuzz,
navigate to warmup folder then run the following.
```
jest fizzbuzz
```
